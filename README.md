Please read the blog attached to this repository on my website : [Let us play with emotions!](https://www.amankalra.com/machine-learning/let-us-play-with-emotions)

In today’s tutorial, we will play with emotions, quite literally! With the growing trends in machine learning and importance to emulate human character/ traits by machines, it is vital that we understand the importance of emotion in our day to day life. In today’s world, emotional context can be applied to every aspect of our life, be it a morning meme you scroll through to , or the serenity in music, or a kid describing his first day at the guitar class!
